3. Reload your **r/place** tab. If everything went well, you'll see "Getting access token..." in the top right of your screen. The bot is now active, You'll be able to see what the bot is doing through these messages.

**The script will allow for CORS access press 'Allow all' when it pops up!!**

### Cons of this bot

- When the bot places a pixel, it will look as if it wasn't placed, while the bot has already done that (and thus you're in cooldown). You can see the cooldown in the topright of your screen.
